## Features

 - Allows you to move files through each pane, but stops you once you reached the first or last pane.
 - Temporarily disables `core.destroyEmptyPanes` so empty panes do not collapse on themselves when your moving files around.
 - Works well with https://github.com/chemoish/atom-pane-layout

## TODO

 - Investigate whether `up/down` should be supported for complex layouts. Optimally in a grid style layout I would want to be able to move files up and down (Esentially skiping any sibling panes).
